Thanks for trying out my script.

It's an attempt to run everything that is actively update from head and do single user installs where possible instead of using broken **run as root distros**.

If it's in source tracking and builds globally I do that.

It's a happy medium I think.  Source tracking means you're installed globally.  Already in mainline means you're installed globally (mostly).  Otherwise per user install.

No run always as **root**.  Not installing another distro.  No hunting and pecking.  It just works.

Thanks again.

**It just works.**
